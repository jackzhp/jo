The Project Description


From a simpler and concrete point of view, this project is trying to maintain a database(constructing is the intial step).

This is a database of daily life knowledge. To be more specific and oversimplified, it is a dictionary.
And because multiple languages are involved, so to some extent, it is a rule based translator.

Let's first focus on Tagalog, English, Japanese, (and maybe Chinese), I guess it can be adapted to other languages as well.

Knowledge presentation for:
  words with their meanings and usages, not just about writing system, but also the audio.
  regular sentence structures and idomatic expressions, and for each of them, many different kinds of explainations can be attached to it.
  we don't look for perfection, but for progress.
  we don't look for completeness, but for some concrete and reliable examples.  
  we believe, in the domain of the daily life, the knowledges even the abstract concepts are enumerable.


And the representation of knowledges are for human to read, to update, to dispute, and to refute.

For a given a dispute, we will represent the dispute with their support information.


Artithecture

For the back end: I would hope to use a framework with rust such as Rocket(https://rocket.rs/ or other see https://github.com/flosse/rust-web-framework-comparison). but we can just use java, even javascript.
  For database, we can use traditional database, or NoSeq DB, or just json file.
For the front end: just HTML + javascript. any framework is ok for me, Vue? or nothing. depends on what the team member is capable of doing it.

The size of the team:
  At least 4 members, 2 for the backend and 2 for the front end. 
  
Ways of Collaboration
   Work remote through github
