The ontology of human being's daily life on earth.

The field can be described by many different language, though historically it is described by human natural languages.

With a formal language, an unambiguous description of some stuff might be possible, but I would guess, that would not be desirable. And the obscurity/vagueness/ambiguity in a description with natural language should not be a surprise. 

why this repository?

originally, I was trying to focus on the knowledge of Japanese language, then it becomes the general knowledge of daily life from ontological view. Be aware this is not about ontology itself, but to use ontology as a tool to formally desribe all stuff happened in daily life.

Please check wiki page for the reason why why this repository exists.

Still too complicated, so now I think I just focus on integer related knowledge: to discuss integer with computer(treat it as a AI human).

what is integer?
prime or not prime, even or odd, what is twin primes?
for example, 

Ask the question "how to determine a number is even?", the computer should give meaningful response(a knowledge representation in some language).
Ask the question "how to detemine a number is prime?" .....
Question: please give an example of integer, the AI use generator to produce one. Here, the AI does not have to tell how to generate the one.
         not larger than 100.
Question: Do you know what a prime is? the AI should check its knowledge base, then respond.
Question: what is an integer? the AI should respond give meaningful response(a knowledge representation in some language).


Entity: Integer, prime integer, composite, even integer, odd integer, algorithm to determine a number is a prime. 
relation of 2: compare 2 number  a <=> b 
relation of 3: a = m*n     a ==b %(n)
relation of 4:  a= m*n + b
relation of an equation:
algorithm: add, sub, multiply, divide, mod
concept and instance

One thing: the AI can does a complicate prime test. We human generate an integer example.
another thing: the AI has the retrospect ability to tell how it is done. we human tell how the integer is generated.
