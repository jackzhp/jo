The ontology of human being's daily life on earth.

The field can be described by many different language, though historically it is described by human natural languages.

With a formal language, an unambiguous description of some stuff might be possible, but I would guess, that would not be desirable. And the obscurity/vagueness/ambiguity in a description with natural language should not be a surprise. 

why this repository?

originally, I was trying to focus on the knowledge of Japanese language, then it becomes the general knowledge of daily life from ontological view. Be aware this is not about ontology itself, but to use ontology as a tool to formally desribe all stuff happened in daily life.

Please check wiki page for the reason why why this repository exists.

Still too complicated, so now I think I just focus on integer related knowledge: to discuss integer with computer(treat it as a AI human).
