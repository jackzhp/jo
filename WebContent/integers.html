	why this?

	<ul>
		<li>reason 1 as mentioned in "[[The first objective of NLP]]"
			page.</li>
		<li>human understands computer's language, so we can instruct a
			computer to do whatever we want. This project is aimed to require a
			computer to understand human's language through knowledge graph or
			some kind of knowledge representation as an intermediate. why not to
			require the computer to understand human's language directly but
			through a normalized knowledge representation? If we require the
			computer to understand a human's language, we have no idea whether
			the computer really understands it. With the unambiguous formalized
			knowledge representation, we hope both computer and human can
			understand. And we, as human being, can request the computer to
			output the knowledge representation, so we can check whether the
			computer really understand the human's language. </br> Between human's
			language and the normalized knowledge representation, there are some
			ambiguity. one human sentence might have several different meanings
			while each of them can be represented formally. From human's language
			to the formalized knowledge representation, it should be easy for
			human to check its validity and its completeness. But after the
			normalized knowledge representation, even ambiguity is needed, will
			be part of the computing model.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Tasks</h3>
	Though I still don't know how to represent the related knowledge
	properly, I started to expect the computer AI can master that knowledge
	and interact with a human through natural language such as English or
	Japanese.

	<ol>
		<li>AI gets the knowledge through natural language such as
			Japanese. the result of this step is the formalized knowledge
			representation. Right now, I will skip this step, by manually
			construct knowledge representation for the AI.
		<li>How can AI master that knowledge? in a simple DB. I will
			manually maintain a simple DB. this is current focus.
		<li>How can AI understand a question(represented with formal
			representation or with Japanese)? At present, hardwire the question
			directly.
		<li>with that knowledge, how can AI represent what it knows for a
			specific question? hardwire it for temp.
	</ol>
	Given the focus is the core of the 2nd point, why do I have the 3rd and
	the 4th? Only through relevant application, we can see whether the
	knowledge representation is appropriate.


	<h2>how to represent related knowledge?</h2>
	Let's try with ontology. what is integer? ClassInteger: next, previous,
	isEven, isOdd, isPrime EntityInteger: Number system: binary, decimal,
	octal, etc. IntegerAdd, IntegerSub, IntegerMultiply, IntegerDivide,
	IntegerMod, IntegerPower, ReverseOperation prime or not prime, even or
	odd, what is twin primes? for example, Entity: Integer, prime integer,
	composite, even integer, odd integer, algorithm to determine a number
	is a prime.
	<ul>
		<li>relation of 2: compare 2 number a <=> b %(n)
		<li>relation of 4: a= m*n + b <l i> relat ion of an equation:
			sequentially test. 
	</ul>

	algorithm:
	<ul>
		<li>add,
		<li>sub,
		<li>multiply,
		<li>divide,
		<li>mod
	</ul>
	all these calculation is easy for a computer, but it does it
	unconsciously, so it is not that easy for the computer to discuss this
	with a human. concept and instance

	<p>
		One thing: the AI can does a complicate prime test. We human generate
		an integer example. <br /> another thing: the AI has the retrospect
		ability to tell how it is done. we human tell how the integer is
		generated.
	</p>

	<h3>Questions for AI:</h3>


	<ol>
		<li>"how to determine a number is even?", the computer should
			give meaningful response(a knowledge representation in some
			language).
		<li>"how to detemine a number is prime?" .....
		<li>please give an example of integer, the AI use generator to
			produce one. Here, the AI does not have to tell how to generate the
			one. not larger than 100.
		<li>Do you know what a prime is? the AI should check its
			knowledge base, then respond.
		<li>what is an integer? the AI should respond give meaningful
			response(a knowledge representation in some language).
		<li>is 6 dividable by 3?
		<li>to discuss the problem 1+2+...+100=?
		<li>to discuss different method to do multiplication: Karatsuba
			multiplication, Toomâ€“Cook multiplication, etc.
	</ol>
